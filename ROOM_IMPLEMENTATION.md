### Database Layer

#### **Entities**
1. `/app/src/main/java/com/example/furniturecloudy/database/entity/RecentlyViewed.kt`
   - Stores: productId, name, price, image, category, stock, offerPercentage, viewedAt
   - Primary Key: productId
   - Auto-updates viewedAt timestamp on re-view

2. `/app/src/main/java/com/example/furniturecloudy/database/entity/SearchHistory.kt`
   - Stores: id (auto-generated), query, timestamp
   - Tracks all user searches with timestamps

#### **DAOs**
3. `/app/src/main/java/com/example/furniturecloudy/database/dao/RecentlyViewedDao.kt`
   - `getRecentlyViewed()`: Returns Flow of last 10 viewed products
   - `insertViewed()`: Saves/updates viewed product
   - `deleteOldViews()`: Cleans up views older than 30 days
   - `clearAll()`: Clears all history

4. `/app/src/main/java/com/example/furniturecloudy/database/dao/SearchHistoryDao.kt`
   - `getRecentSearches()`: Returns Flow of last 10 searches
   - `getSuggestions()`: Get autocomplete suggestions based on prefix
   - `insertSearch()`: Saves search query
   - `deleteOldSearches()`: Cleans up searches older than 90 days
   - `deleteSearch()`: Delete specific search
   - `clearHistory()`: Clear all searches

#### **Database**
5. `/app/src/main/java/com/example/furniturecloudy/database/FurnitureDatabase.kt`
   - Room database with version 1
   - Includes both SearchHistory and RecentlyViewed entities

#### **Repositories**
6. `/app/src/main/java/com/example/furniturecloudy/database/repository/RecentlyViewedRepository.kt`
   - Provides clean API for recently viewed operations
   - Converts between Room entities and Product data class
   - Auto-maintains max 10 items
   - Auto-cleanup of old items (>30 days)

7. `/app/src/main/java/com/example/furniturecloudy/database/repository/SearchHistoryRepository.kt`
   - Provides clean API for search history operations
   - Returns search suggestions for autocomplete
   - Auto-cleanup of old searches (>90 days)

## üìù Files Modified

### Dependency Injection

8. **`/app/build.gradle.kts`**
   - Added Room dependencies (v2.6.1)
   - Added Gson for JSON conversion (v2.10.1)
   - Uses KSP for annotation processing

9. **`/app/src/main/java/com/example/furniturecloudy/di/Module.kt`**
   - Added `provideFurnitureDatabase()`: Creates Room database instance
   - Added `provideSearchHistoryDao()`: Provides SearchHistoryDao
   - Added `provideRecentlyViewedDao()`: Provides RecentlyViewedDao

### Feature Integration

10. **`ProductDetailFragment.kt`**
    - Injected `RecentlyViewedRepository`
    - Automatically saves product to Recently Viewed when fragment opens
    - Works seamlessly with existing product detail logic

11. **`MainCategoryFragment.kt`** (Home Tab)
    - Added "S·∫£n ph·∫©m ƒë√£ xem" section
    - Shows/hides section based on whether there are recently viewed products
    - Horizontal scrollable RecyclerView
    - Clicking product navigates to detail page
    - Auto-updates when products are viewed

12. **`fragment_main_category.xml`**
    - Added `tvRecentlyViewed` TextView (title)
    - Added `recvRecentlyViewed` RecyclerView
    - Both hidden by default, shown when data available
    - Positioned between Special Products and Best Deals

13. **`SearchFragment.kt`**
    - Injected `SearchHistoryRepository`
    - Saves search query to history when user submits search
    - Ready for future autocomplete implementation

## üéØ How It Works

### Recently Viewed Products Flow

```
User opens Product Detail
        ‚Üì
ProductDetailFragment.onViewCreated()
        ‚Üì
recentlyViewedRepository.addRecentlyViewed(product)
        ‚Üì
Saved to Room Database (replaces if exists)
        ‚Üì
MainCategoryFragment observes Flow
        ‚Üì
UI updates automatically
        ‚Üì
Shows "S·∫£n ph·∫©m ƒë√£ xem" section with products
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Automatically tracks last 10 viewed products
- ‚úÖ Most recently viewed appears first
- ‚úÖ Auto-deletes products older than 30 days
- ‚úÖ Works offline (persists across app restarts)
- ‚úÖ Real-time updates using Flow
- ‚úÖ Hidden when no products viewed yet

### Search History Flow

```
User types in SearchView and hits submit
        ‚Üì
SearchFragment.onQueryTextSubmit()
        ‚Üì
searchHistoryRepository.addSearch(query)
        ‚Üì
Saved to Room Database
        ‚Üì
Auto-deletes searches older than 90 days
        ‚Üì
Available for future autocomplete
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Saves all search queries
- ‚úÖ Auto-deletes old searches (>90 days)
- ‚úÖ Supports getting suggestions (for future autocomplete UI)
- ‚úÖ Works offline
- ‚úÖ Prevents empty/blank searches

## üöÄ Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Search Autocomplete Dropdown
To add autocomplete suggestions, you can:

1. Add a ListView or RecyclerView below SearchView in `fragment_search.xml`
2. Observe search history in SearchFragment:
```kotlin
viewLifecycleOwner.lifecycleScope.launch {
    searchHistoryRepository.getRecentSearches().collect { suggestions ->
        // Update autocomplete adapter with suggestions
    }
}
```
3. Show dropdown when SearchView gets focus
4. Hide when user selects a suggestion or clears focus

### Clear History Buttons
Add options to:
- Clear all recently viewed products
- Clear search history
- Delete individual search items

### Search Suggestions Based on Typing
Currently saves only on submit. You could:
- Show suggestions as user types using `getSuggestions(prefix)`
- Match partial queries for better UX

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Recently Viewed
- [ ] Open a product detail page
- [ ] Navigate back to Home tab
- [ ] Verify "S·∫£n ph·∫©m ƒë√£ xem" section appears
- [ ] Click on recently viewed product ‚Üí navigates to detail
- [ ] View 5 different products
- [ ] Verify all 5 appear in recently viewed (newest first)
- [ ] Close and restart app
- [ ] Verify recently viewed persists

### Search History
- [ ] Go to Search tab
- [ ] Type "chair" and submit search
- [ ] Type "table" and submit search
- [ ] Close and restart app
- [ ] Search history is preserved (for future autocomplete)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Data Retention Periods
Currently configured in repositories:

**Recently Viewed:** 30 days
```kotlin
val thirtyDaysAgo = System.currentTimeMillis() - (30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000L)
```

**Search History:** 90 days
```kotlin
val ninetyDaysAgo = System.currentTimeMillis() - (90 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000L)
```

To change, modify the constants in:
- `RecentlyViewedRepository.kt`
- `SearchHistoryRepository.kt`

### Maximum Items Limit

**Recently Viewed:** 10 items (enforced in DAO query)
```kotlin
@Query("SELECT * FROM recently_viewed ORDER BY viewedAt DESC LIMIT 10")
```

**Search History:** 10 items displayed (enforced in DAO query)
```kotlin
@Query("SELECT DISTINCT query FROM search_history ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10")
```

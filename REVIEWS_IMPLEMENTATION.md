## 🔥 How It Works

### User Workflow

```
Product Detail Page
        ↓
User clicks "+ Thêm đánh giá"
        ↓
Dialog opens with:
  - Star rating selector (1-5)
  - Comment text field
        ↓
User fills in and clicks "Gửi đánh giá"
        ↓
System validates:
  ✓ Rating selected (not 0)
  ✓ Comment not empty
  ✓ User hasn't already reviewed
        ↓
System checks:
  - Has user purchased this product?
  - Sets verified = true/false
        ↓
Review saved to Firestore /Reviews collection
        ↓
Real-time updates:
  - Review appears in list immediately
  - Average rating recalculated
  - Review count updated
        ↓
Success message: "Cảm ơn bạn đã đánh giá!"
```

### Technical Flow

```
ReviewViewmodel.addReview()
        ↓
Check: Has user already reviewed? (Firestore query)
        ↓
If yes: Show error "Bạn đã đánh giá sản phẩm này rồi"
If no: Continue ↓
        ↓
Check purchase history in /user/{uid}/order
  - Loop through all user orders
  - Check if any order contains this productId
  - Set verified = true if found
        ↓
Create Review object with:
  - Auto-generated ID
  - Product ID
  - User ID, name, image
  - Rating, comment
  - Timestamp (auto)
  - Verified status
        ↓
Save to Firestore /Reviews/{reviewId}
        ↓
Snapshot listener auto-updates UI
        ↓
Calculate average from all reviews
Update review count
```

## 🗄️ Firestore Structure

### Reviews Collection

**Path:** `/Reviews/{reviewId}`

**Document Structure:**
```javascript
{
  "id": "review_12345",
  "productId": "prod_abc123",
  "userId": "user_xyz789",
  "userName": "Nguyễn Văn A",
  "userImage": "https://firebasestorage.../profile.jpg",
  "rating": 4.5,
  "comment": "Sản phẩm rất tốt, giao hàng nhanh!",
  "timestamp": Timestamp(2025, 10, 3, 14, 30, 0),
  "verified": true
}
```

### Indexes Required

**Firestore Composite Index:**
- Collection: `Reviews`
- Fields indexed:
  1. `productId` (Ascending)
  2. `timestamp` (Descending)

**Why:** Enables querying reviews by product ID sorted by newest first

## 📊 Firebase Rules Recommendations

Add these to Firestore Security Rules:

```javascript
// Reviews collection rules
match /Reviews/{reviewId} {
  // Anyone can read reviews
  allow read: if true;

  // Only authenticated users can create reviews
  allow create: if request.auth != null
                && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid
                && request.resource.data.rating >= 1
                && request.resource.data.rating <= 5;

  // Users can only update/delete their own reviews
  allow update, delete: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
}
```

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### For Existing Products (Data Migration)

If you have existing products without rating fields, update Firestore:

**Option 1: Firebase Console**
1. Go to Firestore
2. Select Products collection
3. Edit each document
4. Add fields: `averageRating: 0`, `reviewCount: 0`

**Option 2: Cloud Functions (Recommended)**
```javascript
const functions = require('firebase-functions');
const admin = require('firebase-admin');

// Run once to migrate existing products
exports.migrateProducts = functions.https.onRequest(async (req, res) => {
  const productsSnapshot = await admin.firestore().collection('Products').get();

  const batch = admin.firestore().batch();
  productsSnapshot.forEach(doc => {
    batch.update(doc.ref, {
      averageRating: 0,
      reviewCount: 0
    });
  });

  await batch.commit();
  res.send('Migration complete');
});
```

### Update Ratings Automatically (Firebase Function)

```javascript
exports.updateProductRating = functions.firestore
  .document('Reviews/{reviewId}')
  .onCreate(async (snap, context) => {
    const review = snap.data();
    const productId = review.productId;

    // Get all reviews for this product
    const reviewsSnapshot = await admin.firestore()
      .collection('Reviews')
      .where('productId', '==', productId)
      .get();

    const reviews = reviewsSnapshot.docs.map(doc => doc.data());
    const averageRating = reviews.reduce((sum, r) => sum + r.rating, 0) / reviews.length;

    // Update product
    await admin.firestore().collection('Products').doc(productId).update({
      averageRating: averageRating,
      reviewCount: reviews.length
    });
  });
```

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Manual Product Rating Update:**
   - Currently, `averageRating` and `reviewCount` in Product model need manual update
   - **Solution:** Implement Firebase Cloud Function (see setup above)

2. **No Edit Review:**
   - Users cannot edit submitted reviews
   - **Solution:** Add edit functionality in future phase

3. **No Photo Reviews:**
   - Reviews are text-only currently
   - **Solution:** Add image upload in future enhancement

---

## 📞 Support

**Issues to Watch:**
- Firestore index creation prompt (click link to create)
- Security rules deployment
- First review submission may need index (wait ~1 minute)

**Common Errors:**
- "PERMISSION_DENIED" → Update Firestore rules
- "Index required" → Click the link in error to create index
- "Bạn đã đánh giá..." → Duplicate prevention working correctly

---

**Implementation Time:** ~4-5 hours
**Production Ready:** ✅ Yes (after Firestore setup)
**Complexity:** Medium
**User Impact:** High (essential e-commerce feature)
